Some basic concepts:
<ul>
    <li>AP / EP:
        <ul>
            <li>summary of stats and skills that affect the chance to hit/evade. It doesn't include situational modifiers (e.g. from skills based on the type of an enemy), but does include environmental modifiers (e.g. lower EP in "narrow" areas) </li>
            <li>AP equal to enemy EP, results in 50% chance to hit an enemy. </li>
            <li>EP equal to enemy AP, results in 33% chance to dodge an enemy attack. </li>
            <li>Scaling is linear, so for 100%, excluding other bonuses and penalties, you need 2x and 3x more than enemy has. </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>Stamina:
        <ul>
            <li>When stamina drops to 0, character's attack speed and attack power are cut in half.</li>
            <li>Penalty can be lowered via the "Persistence" skill, leveled by fighting with no stamina</li>
            <li>It can also be delayed by raising the max stamina and/or using food items, which provide stamina regeneration in combat</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Attack speed:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Directly translates to how quickly someone attacks in comparison to another fight participant. 2x more => 2x faster. 2x less => 2x slower.
            </li>
            <li>
                To avoid insanity and potential problems, when new fight begins, both character and enemies have their attack cooldowns scaled up so that no one attacks faster than once per second.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Area types and day-night:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Some combat areas have special properties, which result in penalties to certain stats. E.g. some areas might not offer enough movement space to properly dodge or make a good swing with weapon
                <br>
                They usually have a corresponding skill that lowers the penalty and is usually leveled by simply being in such place
            </li>
            <li>
                During night (20 to 4) in normal areas, and whole time in dark areas (e.g. caves), character receives additional penalties to hit/evasion chance.
                <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Items:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Equipment quality 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All equippable items come with "quality" parameter. It directly multiplies item's basic bonus (attack for weapons, defense for armors, max block for shields) and value.
                        <br>
                        On top of that, higher quality ranks (starting at uncommon, which begins at 100%) provide another multiplier (based solely on rank) to not only basic bonus, but also to all other stats it has.
