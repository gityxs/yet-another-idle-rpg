<h4>Found a bug? Let me know. Game has a corner on Arcanum's discord server's Proto23 channel, and there's also a post on r/incremental_games discord server</h4>
<h4>Game was heavily inspired by <a href="https://23html.github.io" target="_blank">Proto23</a>. Huge thanks to Corc for creating it!</h4>

As of v0.3.5, content basically ends after leaving the village. 
You can try fighting the wolves, but they are not expected to be easily beatable at this stage.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            10 W = 1 C, 100 C = 1 S, 100 S = 1 G

                            As you sell more of enemy loot, its price will slowly go down, stopping at 1/10th of initial value. It applies to all traders. 
                            <br>The price will recover over time, but it is very slow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>Stamina:
            <ul>
                <li>When stamina drops to 0, character's attack speed and attack power are cut in half.</li>
                <li>Penalty can be lowered via the "Persistence" skill, leveled by fighting with no stamina</li>
                <li>It can also be delayed by raising the max stamina and/or using food items, which provide stamina regeneration in combat</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>AP / EP:
            <ul>
                <li>Summary of stats and skills that affect the chance to hit/evade. It doesn't include situational modifiers (e.g. from skills based on the type of an enemy), but does include environmental modifiers (e.g. lower EP in "narrow" areas) </li>
                <li>Scaling is non-linear.</li>
                <li>AP equal to 5 times the enemy EP, results in ~98% chance to hit the target. </li>
                <li>AP equal to twice the enemy EP, results in ~80% chance to hit the target. </li>
                <li>AP equal to enemy EP, results in a bit over 50% chance to hit the target. </li>
                <li>AP equal to half of the enemy EP, results in ~24% chance to hit the target. </li>
                <li>AP equal to 1/5 of the enemy EP, results in ~5% chance to hit the target. </li>
            </ul> 
        </li><br>
        <li>Hit / dodge chance
            <ul>
                <li>Displayed in an enemy during combat</li>
                <li>They represent ENEMY's chance to hit or to dodge attacks</li>
            </ul> 
        </li><br>
        <li>Defensive measures
            <ul>
                <li>"Dodge" will always completely negate damage if it happens.</li>
                <li>Shield can absorb damage and has very high base chance, but usually won't be strong enough to reduce it to 0, although it is possible.</li>
                <li>"Defense" provides a flat reduction to damage taken. It is applied after shield dmg reduction.<br>
                    It can't reduce damage taken to less than 1. However, if less than 1 dmg gets through the shield, that value will be used instead.</li>
            </ul> 
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Attack speed:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Directly translates to how quickly someone attacks in comparison to another fight participant. 2x more => 2x faster. 2x less => 2x slower.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To avoid insanity and potential problems, when new fight begins, both character and enemies have their attack cooldowns scaled up so that no one attacks faster than once per second.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Area types and day-night:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some combat areas have special properties, which result in penalties to certain stats. E.g. some areas might not offer enough movement space to properly dodge or make a good swing with weapon
                    <br>
                    They usually have a corresponding skill that lowers the penalty and is usually leveled by simply being in such place
                </li>
                <li>
                    During night (20 to 4) in normal areas, and whole time in dark areas (e.g. caves), character receives additional penalties to hit/evasion chance.
                    <br>
                    This penalty can be reduced with "Night  vision" skill, which gains xp passively just for being in such place
                    <br>
                </li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>XP points:
            <ul>
                <li>Harder enemies generally provide more xp. It is not affected by area modifiers, but is affected by how many enemies are in a group (raised to 0.334, giving x2 in a fight against 8)</li>
                <li>There is also a lot of bonuses from multiple sources (mainly skill milestones and completed books).</li>
            </ul>

                    They multiply leveling speed of their children if these are of lower level

                    They stay on the same level as their highest-leveled child

                    Equipment quality 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All equippable items come with "quality" parameter. It directly multiplies item's basic bonus (attack for weapons, defense for armors, max block for shields) and value.
                            <br>
                            On top of that, higher quality ranks (starting at uncommon, which begins at 100%) provide another multiplier (based solely on rank) to not only basic bonus, but also to all other stats it has.
