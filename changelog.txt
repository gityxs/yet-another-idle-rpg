v0.0.2
    - fixed all the bugs I managed to find; 
    fighting against groups now should work without any issues (other than balance)

    - restructured a lot of code, mostly moved stuff to new locations,
    but also created some new methods for updating the display

    - moved the page selection buttons to the top
    - switched from fontawesome to google icons
